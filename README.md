# carRental
 
the livestream started at 21 & ended at 01 in morning, which resulted the project above, the project was about a carRental Agency  with authentification & administration to manage website sections, and cars informations as well as user manangement, 

we used laravel breeze as anthentification, we've added roles &  permissions to users, with diffrent level of access, the first time i tried the approach of a stubs begining that helps a lot with repetition,
making strict types to model & php files.
